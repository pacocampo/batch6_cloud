# Example usage of the Google Cloud Storage bucket template with lifecycle
# and object versioning enabled.
#
# In this example, a storage bucket is created in the us-east1 location.
# Cloud storage bucket names must be globally unique.
# For bucket and object naming guidelines,
# refer to https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming.
#
# Replace the <FIXME:bucket_name> placeholder with a globally unique storage
# bucket name. For details, refer to
# https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets.
