# Example usage of the Google Cloud Storage bucket template.
#
# In this example, a storage bucket is created in the us-east1 location.
# Cloud storage bucket names must be globally unique.
# For bucket and object naming guidelines,
# refer to https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming.
#
# IAM Policies are also applied with the `bindings` section.
#
# Replace the following placeholders with the relevant values:
#   <FIXME:bucket_name>: a globally unique storage bucket name
#   <FIXME:user_account_email_address>: a valid user account
#   <FIXME:service_account_email_address>: a valid service account email
#   address
# 
# For details, refer to
# https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets.
