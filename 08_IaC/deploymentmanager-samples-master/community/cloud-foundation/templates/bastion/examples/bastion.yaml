# Example of the Bastion host template usage.
#
# This example creates a Bastion host with two SSH rules in the default
# network. The first firewall rule allows the Bastion host to receive the SSH
# traffic. The second rule allows other hosts with the 'example-bastion-target'
# tag to receive the SSH traffic from the Bastion host.
