# Example of a config that has no dependencies.
#
# Notice the 'name' and 'project' yaml directives are not specified in this
# config, meaning that the deployment name will be obtained from the filename
# (without the extension), and the project needs to be specified via one of
# these methods, in this order of precedence:
# 1- The '--project' command line option (highest precedence)
# 2- The 'project' directive in this config file
# 3- The CLOUD_FOUNDATION_TOOLKIT_PROJECT_ID environment variable
# 4- The default projected configured with the CGP SDK
