# Deployment Manager Examples

Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an infrastructure management service that makes it simple to create, deploy, and manage Google Cloud Platform resources. With Deployment Manager, you can create a static or dynamic template that describes the configuration of your Google Cloud environment and then use Deployment Manager to create these resources as a single deployment.

This repository contains example templates for use with Deployment Manager.

For an overview of Deployment Manager, see https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs.

## Try the samples

Clone this repostory into [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/), edit the samples, and deploy them from within Cloud Shell, without installing anything.

To try a basic deployment in Cloud Shell, open the [quickstart tutorial](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fdeploymentmanager-samples&page=editor&tutorial=quickstart.md).

## Cloud Foundation Toolkit

We are happy to introduce the Cloud Foundation Toolkit to provide a common baseline of GCP best practices implemented with infrastructure as code.

A large portion of the templates is available under [community/cloud-foundation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples/tree/master/community/cloud-foundation), templates that had been reviewed but are not yet finalized can be found at the [cloud-foundation branch](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples/tree/cloud-foundation/community/cloud-foundation)

These templates are setting a high standard for infrastructure automation by adding a detailed schema, documentation and integration tests. The example configuration allows you to deploy these templates within minutes.
